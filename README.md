# Remove Duplicate Crafting Recipes

Why craft stone bricks when you can use a stone cutter?  I like the stone cutter so much I think it should be the exclusive crafting block to make slabs, stairs, and walls.

This datapack removes all crafting recipes from the game where you can craft the item using a stone cutter.  For example, you can craft prismarine stairs in a stone cutter, so this mod removes the ability to craft it using a crafting table.

You can see the list of remove crafting table recipes in `remove_list.txt`.  This repository stores a script that generates the datapack from this list.
