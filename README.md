# Remove Duplicate Crafting Recipes

The crafting bench is overutilized in minecraft.  Update 1.16 made strides in removing this dependency.  By adding the stonecutter, loom, and cartography table, it pulled the focus away from the crafting table as the end-all solution for crafting.

But the game still allows you to use the crafting table for many things.  This datapack _forces_ you to leverage all available crafting stations, by removing crafting table recipes that could be accomplished using another tool.  Minecraft removed the many crafting recipes for banner patterns in favor of a better system, but didn't do so for the stone cutter, for instance.

## Progress

Now released for 1.19.

- [x] Stone cutter recipes
- [x] Cartography table recipes
- [x] Item repair

## Stone Cutter Recipes

Stairs, slabs, walls, chiseled, tiles, bricks, and cut variants of blocks can all be done through a stone cutter.  We can remove all of the crafting table recipes for these items.

## Cartography Table Recipes

Maps don't need to be duplicated or expanded anymore in a crafting table due to the cartography table.

## Item Repair

You can combine two items together to add their durability together in your inventory.  Not only can you do this on a grindstone, but a grindstone also gives you bonus durability.
